  <h2>WEB</h2>
	<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are
		identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
		and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the WWW are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
		and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>
